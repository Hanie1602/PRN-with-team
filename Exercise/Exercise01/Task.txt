Exercise 1: TCP Chat Server and Client
Objective: Create a simple chat application using TCP sockets.

Task:
Implement a TCP server that listens for incoming connections on a specified port.
Implement a TCP client that connects to the server.
Enable clients to send messages to the server, and the server broadcasts these messages to all connected clients.

Requirements:
The server must handle multiple clients simultaneously using threading or asynchronous programming.
Messages from one client should be broadcasted to all connected clients, including the sender.
Provide a simple console interface for both the server and clients to send and display messages.

Hints:
Use TcpListener for the server and TcpClient for the client.
Use NetworkStream to read and write data between the server and clients.
Consider implementing message framing or a simple delimiter for consistent communication.
